This Python script automates the process of maintaining an IP allow list in a company's security system. It reads the current list of allowed IP addresses from a file, removes any IPs that are specified in a separate remove list, and then updates the file with the revised list. 

UPDATED: 

1. Error Handling:

File Handling Errors: Add try-except blocks to handle potential file I/O errors, such as the file not existing, permission issues, or other unexpected errors.
Data Validation: Ensure that the IP addresses in the remove_list are valid and correctly formatted before attempting to remove them from the ip_address_list.

2. Logging:

Activity Logging: Implement logging to record when the script runs, which IPs were removed, and any errors encountered. This is especially important in a production environment where auditing and tracking changes are necessary.
